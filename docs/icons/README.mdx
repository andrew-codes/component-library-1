# Icons

`Icons` are great for conveying complex information in a simple manner.
Avoid using `Icons` outside of an `IconButton`, `EmptyState`, or `Avatar`

Prior to adding in an icon, make sure the icons file is named the way you want to refer to it
in React code. For example, below you see the usage of a Delete icon. This icon is named
`delete.svg`, and the usage of it in React is `<DeleteIcon />`. Add your icon into the directory
`VersionOne.Web/css/images/svg` and run the build steps `./gulp build:svg` and
`./gulp build:svg:components`. Once you do you should see it listed below in the set of all icons.

## Basic Usage

<Playground>
  <DeleteIcon />
</Playground>

## API

<PropsTable of={BaseIcon} />
