# Icons

`Icons` are great for conveying complex information in a simple manner. Avoid using `Icons` outside of an `IconButton`, `EmptyState`, or `Avatar`

## Basic Usage

<Playground>
  <DeleteIcon />
</Playground>

## Adding New Icons

> Remember, all icons should be **monochromatic**.

Prior to adding in an icon, make sure the icon file is named without the word "icon". For example, below is the usage of a Delete icon. This icon is named `delete.svg`, and the usage of it in React is `<DeleteIcon />`. Add your icon into the directory `./packages/icons/src/svg`. Re-running `yarn start` will cause the icon to be built and visible in the list of [all icons](/icons/all)

## API

<PropsTable of={Base} />
